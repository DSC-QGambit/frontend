    "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida coach Mike White declined to do any postgame media interviews. He wanted to get to the hospital to be near Keyontae Johnson\u2019s side as quickly as possible.\n\nNo one could blame him.\n\nJohnson, the Southeastern Conference\u2019s preseason player of the year, collapsed coming out of a timeout against rival Florida State and needed emergency medical attention Saturday. Johnson was taken off the floor on a stretcher and rushed to Tallahassee Memorial for evaluation. The team said he was in critical but stable condition and later said he would remain in the hospital overnight.\n\nJohnson\u2019s parents were flying in from Virginia to be with their son.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re fighting bro,\u201d teammate Tre Mann tweeted after the game ended. \u201cGod got you.\u201d\n\nJohnson had just dunked in transition before he crumpled to the floor as the team broke its huddle. Several Gators were in tears and a couple buried their faces in towels as White gathered them in prayer.\n\nOfficials gave the teams time to regroup, and the game continued a few minutes later. Florida State coach Leonard Hamilton said administrators twice gave the Gators the option of stopping or continuing the game \u2014 at that time and again at halftime \u2014 and said they ultimately decided to play. White let his players make the call.\n\nFlorida wasn\u2019t the same afterward, getting outscored 80-60 following Johnson\u2019s sudden and disconcerting exit. The 20th-ranked Seminoles won 83-71, extending their winning streak in the series to seven and their winning streak at home to 26.\n\n\u201cPlease keep praying for @Keyontae and his family,\u201d White posted on Twitter. \u201cWe all love him.\u201d\n\nAuburn coach Bruce Pearl gathered his team together after practice, told them about Johnson\u2019s situation, and asked them join an assistant in prayer. The team posted a video of it on social media.\n\nJohnson, a 6-foot-5 junior from Norfolk, Virginia, averaged a team-high 14 points last season to go along with 7.1 rebounds. He also led the Gators with 38 steals.\n\nHe scored five points in four minutes Saturday.\n\n\u201cThose types of things can affect you in some adverse ways,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWe\u2019re just all hopeful and praying that he\u2019s OK. If it affected our players in an emotional way, I can imagine what the situation was with his teammates.\u201d\n\nLike many of his Florida teammates, Johnson tested positive for COVID-19 during the summer. Although the cause of Johnson\u2019s ailment was not immediately known, the coronavirus can lead to myocarditis, a viral infection of the heart muscle. At its most severe, myocarditis can lead to sudden cardiac arrest and has been a documented cause of death for young, otherwise healthy athletes.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference mandates strict protocols, including rigorous heart testing, before players can be cleared to return to play following positive COVID-19 tests.",

(AP) \u2013 Sarah Fuller became the first woman to score in a Power Five conference football game by kicking an extra point for Vanderbilt on Saturday.\n\nThe goalkeeper for Vanderbilt\u2019s Southeastern Conference women\u2019s soccer champs didn\u2019t get a chance on the Commodores\u2019 first two drives against in-state rival Tennessee. But the Commodores drove late in the first quarter, running for a first down on fourth-and-1.\n\nOn the next play, Ken Seals threw an 18-yard pass to Cam Johnson for a touchdown. Fuller, listed second out of three available kickers on the depth chart, came out for the extra point, which tied the game at 7 with 1:50 left in the first quarter.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 senior put the ball through the uprights and celebrated by pulling her first in before slapping high-fives with teammates. She ran off the field with a big smile with her family in the stands all with their arms up in the air.\n\nIncredible \ud83d\udc4f Sarah Fuller just became the first woman to score in a Power 5 game.
